I have made a total of 4 apis in this project, out of which I had mainly made 2 api post method for inserting bulk data and get api for fetching bulk data and I have also used them on frontend. I have made 4 apis for get, put post and delete , for which I have used tech stack, node js, express js, mongo db, mongoose and react and I have done all this on local server and I am pasting screenshots of whatever work I have done here for your reference.
